## Question 1:

Question 4 on page 76 from Chapter 4 of Data Analysis Using Regression and
Multilevel/Hierarchical Models.  The codebook can be found
[here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/pollution/pollution.txt).
I've included R code blocks for each question, but use them only if you feel it
necessary.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
url <- "http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/pollution/pollution.dta"
pollution <- read.dta(url) %>% 
  tbl_df()
```

### a)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```


### b)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```


### c)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```


### d)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```


### e)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```


### f)

Why do you think one would use cross-validation?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```







## Question 2:

Using the OkCupid data:

* a) Do an Exploratory Data Analysis. Include what you think are the highlights
and or what's relevant to part b).
* b) Fit what you think is a good predictive model for gender
* c) Interpret all results.

For the R Markdown to work, you must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from
Lec09 to the project directory `HW-2`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% tbl_df()
```


### a)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```


### b)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```


### c)
